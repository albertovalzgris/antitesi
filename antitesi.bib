@article{Smith:2013,
	Abstract = { The paper is a critique of a critique; it explains why the most salient and influential critiques of the neo-Marxist world city and global city concepts, made by those arguing to further postcolonialize urban studies through such suppositions that all cities are `ordinary', are misguided. First, it is explained how the charges of economism and ethnocentrism against the world city and global city concepts are ignoratio elenchi: They do not even begin to address or critique their neo-Marxist argument that, across the difference and diversity of the world's cities, a few major cities have the necessary economic specialization and therefore extraordinary function of commanding and controlling neoliberal globalization. Second, the error made by advocates of ordinary cities of supposing that world-systems analysis and the world city concept are forms of developmentalism is understood as the source for a wider postcolonial mistake of conflating the neo-Marxist world city and global city literatures with the very neoliberal practices toward urban development that they have long attempted to disclose and counter. Finally, the charges against the world city and global city concepts as paradigmatic, peripheralizing, and normative are also rebutted, not only to highlight how those critiques are consequentialist and dependent on the respective charges of economism, ethnocentrism, and developmentalism having veracity, but to demonstrate how an acceptance of the ordinary cities argument for an idiographic, provincial, nominalist, and comparative approach to urban studies, as an alternative to the two neo-Marxist concepts, is only to fall into the trap of making the mistake of confusing evidence of absence for absence of evidence. },

@article{angelo:2017,
	Abstract = {In recent years, three superficially distinct urban subfields have made parallel efforts to incorporate the city's traditional `outsides' into urban research. Urban political ecology, American urban sociology and postcolonial urban studies have made, respectively, `nature', the `rural' and the `not-yet' city the objects of self-consciously urban analyses. I argue that these interventions are analogous efforts to hybridise city/nature, city/country or society/nature binaries, and that they have a common cause. Each is a response to a persistent `city lens' that remains pervasive in urban practice, and whose assumptions are an increasingly poor fit for contemporary urban environments. This lens, ground in the context of the 19th century metropolis, interprets the world through a series of binary associations hung on the basic assumption that the city can be defined against a non-urban outside. I develop John Berger's (2008 [1972]) idea of `ways of seeing' as a heuristic for understanding this situation and, using the case of nature, show how the city lens encourages practitioners and some scholars to romanticise, anachronise or generalise when confronting signs of the not-city in the urban. I conclude by evaluating the limitations of hybridity as a solution to the problems of the city lens, and by outlining an alternative approach. I advocate for turning this way of seeing into a research object, and argue for the importance of an historical and process-oriented examination of the ongoing use of these categories even as critical urban scholars attempt to move beyond them. {\copyright} 2016, {\copyright} Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes extending Urban Political Ecology's (UPE) ideas about the urbanisation of nature in order to include the geographical imprints of expanding, global metabolic flows of matter, energy and capital. It does so through the analysis of Huasco, a small agricultural village in northern Chile that has been overburdened with massive energy undertakings aimed at powering the operations of mines that supply raw materials to international markets. Like the sewage and technological networks that feed the life of cities, the paper argues that Huasco-as a metabolic vehicle of planetary urbanisation-has also been hidden from view, and thus the fetishisation of urban infrastructural networks initially theorised by UPE, has been ratcheted-up to the global level by the mediating powers of neoliberalising capitalism. Just as the socio-material arrangements that facilitate the smooth functioning of the modern city and household are riddled with glitches and exclusions, the paper suggests that globally up-scaled infrastructures reveal even larger contradictions that put into jeopardy the very premises upon which the ongoing commodification of nature is grounded. {\copyright} 2015 The Author.},

	Abstract = {This essay reflects on recent debates around planetary urbanization, many of which have been articulated through dismissive caricatures of the core epistemological orientations, conceptual proposals, methodological tactics, and substantive arguments that underpin this emergent approach to the urban question. Following consideration of some of the most prevalent misrepresentations of this work within this special issue, I build upon Barnes and Sheppard's (2010) concept of ``engaged pluralism'' to suggest more productive possibilities for dialogue among critical urban researchers whose agendas are too often viewed as incommensurable or antagonistic rather than as interconnected and, potentially, allied. The essay concludes by outlining nine research questions whose more sustained exploration could more productively connect studies of planetary urbanization to several fruitful lines of inquiry that have been explored within postcolonial, feminist and queer-theoretical strands of urban studies. While questions of positionality necessarily lie at the heart of any critical approach to urban theory and research, so too does the search for intellectual and political common ground that might help orient, animate and advance the shared, if constitutively heterodox, project(s) of critical urban studies. {\copyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a number of recent efforts to critique, dismantle and problematize the categorical ontologies of `the urban' and articulate an overarching epistemological framework for urban theory. Our intervention in these debates, which to date have focused primarily on Henri Lefebvre's hypothesis regarding `planetary urbanization', highlights the absence of an engagement with the long legacy within feminist urban scholarship of confronting and dismantling the categories of the `urban' and `rural'. We argue that attending to this legacy foregrounds two conceptual and intellectual challenges that Lefebvre sets for us in his writings on the urban phenomenon. The first relates to Lefebvre's arguments about the central role that a focus on difference and everyday life must play in understanding late capitalist urbanization and the urban condition. The second relates to Lefebvre's articulation of the simultaneous problem and imperative of epistemological plurality within urban theory, including the role he ascribed to intellectual cooperation on the study of the urban phenomenon. We conclude by offering some thoughts on the importance Lefebvre attached to residual forms of difference -- both lived and epistemological -- in urban research and action, and by extension, probe some of the limits of Lefebvrian frameworks for understanding the contemporary urban condition. {\copyright} 2016, {\copyright} The Author(s) 2016.},

	Abstract = {With the publication of their piece `Towards a New Epistemology of the Urban?' in City 19 (2--3), Neil Brenner and Christian Schmid hoped to ignite a debate about the adequacy of existing epistemologies for understanding urban life today. Brenner and Schmid's desire to set urban research on a new course is premised on a wide-ranging critique of `city-centrism' that they believe is holding back both mainstream and critical urban research. In this paper, we challenge Brenner and Schmid's call for urban theory to shift from a concern with cities as `things' to a concern with processes of concentrated, extended and differentiated urbanization. In their justified desire to critique `urban age' ideologies that treat `the city' as a fixed, bounded and replicable spatial unit, Brenner and Schmid risk robbing critical urban theory of a concept and an orientation that is crucial to both its conceptual clarity and its political efficacy. We offer in its place a conceptual and political defense of `the city' as an anchor for a critical urban studies that can contribute to emancipatory politics. This is absolutely not a call for a return of bounded, universal concepts of `the city' that have rightly been the target of critique. Rather, it is a call for an epistemology of the urban that is founded on an engagement with the political practices of subordinated peoples across a diverse range of cities. For many millions of people across the planet, the particularities of city life continue to be the context from which urbanization processes are experienced, understood, and potentially transformed. {\copyright} 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	Abstract = {This paper begins with the accusation of ``totalization'' that has been directed at Neil Brenner and Christian Schmid's concept of ``planetary urbanization.'' In so doing, it first critiques the meanings typically attributed to ``totality'' and ``totalization'' by Brenner and Schmid as well as their critics, and then explicates the concepts of totality and totalization developed in the tradition of Hegelian Marxism, especially in the works of Georg Luk{\'a}cs, Jean-Paul Sartre, Henri Lefebvre, and Fredric Jameson. Following a review of some influential invocations of Hegelian or Marxist conceptions of totality in anti-colonial and socialist--feminist politics, the paper concludes by arguing that participants in the contentious planetary urbanization debate can best address their substantive concerns by working through instead of disavowing the concept of totality---especially the version of it proposed by Lefebvre, involving state and capital, ``the urban'' and the everyday. {\copyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018.},

	Abstract = {Are we in a new urban moment, or have we never been urban? Recent literatures have theorized the emergence of a new moment or epoch in the history of urbanization (or in urbanization theory?) under a range of terms--the Urban Age, the Anthropocene, planetary urbanization, and so on. This contemporary moment is interpreted as `geohistorical developments [that] pose a fundamental challenge to the entire field of urban studies {\ldots} its basic epistemological assumptions, categories of analysis, and object of investigation require a foundational reconceptualization' (Brenner and Schmid 2012). Underlying the idea of planetary urbanization is a certain temporality--Brenner and Schmid put it at `during the last thirty years' (Brenner and Schmid 2012). Being written in 2012, that dates the current sense of urban catastrophe and destabilizing of conventional epistemological categories to the 1980s. However, Merryfield (2013) footnotes that Wirth's is probably the `best take' on describing planetary urbanization--the reference is to Wirth 1938. The timeline is therefore not strictly precise, nor is periodization the most pressing debate here--it's clear that whenever it might have started, it is now, and it is urgent (see also Gandy, this volume). {\copyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

@article{Khatam2018,
	Abstract = {This paper argues that the `city' as a political entity is significant in struggles over the `urban', by identifying two moments of `differential urbanization' in the Middle East. Our study in Iran and Palestine/Israel shows that the vision of the `city' as a legitimizing space for political citizenship is at the heart of conflicting imaginaries: in Iran, `cities of revolution' built through housing the poor around Tehran, and redistributive politics that stand on filling the `rural/urban gap', and in Palestine, the new city of Rawabi as a city of Palestinian independence, where privatized urban development contrasts colonial spatialities with anti-colonial potentials. Thus, the right to the `urban' involves claims for the `city' that go beyond the capitalist logic of urbanization. This theorization points to a troubling gap in the planetary urbanization thesis, which moves from collapsing the `urban/non-urban' divide into `concentrated', extended' and `differential' urbanization to diminishing the role of distinct sociospatial configurations in claims over the `urban'. Our case studies show that examining the reconfiguration of inherited spatialities in the context of particular political regimes is imperative for epistemology of the `urban' in its planetary stage. Urbanization otherwise remains an uninterrupted process towards a non-spatial `urban condition'. {\copyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018.},

	Abstract = {In Le Droit {\`a} la Ville (1968), Lefebvre projects the urban trajectory of his day into the sci-fi imaginary of Isaac Asimov's remarkable Foundation series, recognizing the germ of 'Trantor' in our midst, the planet of 40 billion inhabitants where urbanization has reached its absolute maximum; all 75 million square miles of Trantor's land surface are a single city. In La R{\'e}volution Urbaine (1970), Lefebvre had already begun hinting at a new reality, not only an urban society, but of planetary urbanization. Today, four decades on, Asimov's extraterrestrial universe seems closer to home than ever, and closer to Lefebvre's own terrestrial prognostications: planetary urbanization is creating a whole new spatial world (dis)order. But how shall we reclaim the shapeless, formless and boundless metropolis as a theoretical object and political object of the progressive struggle? If the arena of politics has no discernible form, what would be the form of these politics? What, exactly, are urban politics? This article tries to rethink theoretically the urban question and the question of urban politics in our era of planetary urbanization, working through the political role of the urban in the light of recent 'Occupy' mobilizations. {\copyright} 2012 Urban Research Publications Limited.},

@article{Rickards20161523,
	Abstract = {For some time now, the field of urban studies has been attempting to figure the urban whilst cognisant of the fact that the city exists as a highly problematic category of analysis. In this virtual special issue, we draw together some examples of what we call urban concepts under stress; concepts which appear to be reaching the limits of their capacity to render knowable a world characterised by the death of the city and the ascent of multi-scalar de-territorialisations and re-territorialisations. We organise the papers selected for inclusion into three bundles dealing respectively with complex urban systems, the hinterland problematic and governing cities in the age of flows. The phenomenon of urban concepts under stress stems from the existence of a gap between existing cartographies, visualisations and lexicons of the urban and 21st century spatial conditions and territorialities. Given that this disarticulation will surely increase as this century unfolds, a pressing question presents itself: what is to be done with the field of urban studies after the age of the city? In this introduction, we argue that there exist at least six ways of responding to the present conceptual difficulties, each implying a different future for urban studies. We place under particular scrutiny voices which argue that nothing less than a scholarly tabula rasa will suffice. Our conclusion is that the phenomenon of concepts under stress provides an opportunity to think afresh about what to do with the field of urban studies and that it is premature to foreclose discussion about possible futures at this point. {\copyright} Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.},

	Abstract = {The anthropological machine is the discursive framework, the dispositif that grounds "Western man" in a sense of civility, secured through a violent division within and between the human and nonhuman: not the after-effect of the civilizing act but its very foundation. This paper explores Agambens machine at multiple sites: in its expression in everyday lives of urban citizens, and its legitimation of capitalist urbanization on broader spatial and temporal scales, its "worlding" through planetary urbanization and normalization of climate change. Complicit in capitalist urbanization and climate change, the anthropological machine has acted as a "switch point" since the 1600s. It now frames an emergent response: triage as the inevitable sacrifice of some peoples and parts of the planet to preserve others. If the urban is to become the site of mondialization, confronting the apparent inevitability of triage we must think beyond the either-or of a people or a planet. Thought in relation to the urban, the anthropological machine offers a meeting ground between urban political economy and assemblage urbanism. It enables us to situate the Anthropocene and differentiate the urban. But it also exposes a deep divide between scholars reframing the human beyond "Western man": between those for whom the more-than-human expresses the dreams of a biophilic city and those for whom the less-than-human is increasingly its living nightmare. {\copyright} 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, the concept of planetary urbanization has provoked a widespread debate. It is grounded upon a basic hypothesis: that the contemporary urbanizing world cannot be adequately understood without systematically revising inherited concepts and representations of the urban. It is therefore first and foremost an invitation to adopt a different perspective, one that decenters the focus of analysis and looks from an ex-centric position on the urban world. This article attempts to clarify some of the most pressing questions that have arisen thus far in the debate on planetary urbanization. It approaches the question of the power of the urban under conditions of planetary urbanization, and explores the nature and role of theory, in relation to urban practice as well as in relation to urban research. Through some reflections on the relationship between the abstract and the concrete in social theory, this paper discusses the much-debated question of ``universalizing'' and ``totalizing'' theoretical engagements, addresses the role of difference and specificity in urban research, and finally evaluates some first results of the various ongoing investigations of planetary urbanization. {\copyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018.},
	Annote = {{\ldots}we propose to explore contemporary urban phenomena from a radical different angle, one that decenters the long-entrenched analytical gaze of urban studies, which demarcate their object of analysis with reference to ``the center''{\ldots}''in contrast, adopting a planetary orientation means first of all decentering the focus of analysis, looking from an ex-centric position, one that looks from the periphery and asks where to find ``the urban. Such an orientation enables a researcher to detect a wide variety of expressions of the urban that have traditionally been excluded from analytical consideration because they are located outside large agglomerations and metropolitan regions and their immediate hinterlands. It also offers a different way of analyzing traditional sites of urban research, because it focuses simultaneously on processes of concentrated, extended and differential urbanization (Brenner and Schmid, 2015). It thus illuminates the wider context of an urban territory and traces the effects of the various relationships and mutual interactions between centralities and peripheries.''},

	Abstract = { The `urban question' isn't a question with an answer---not like the `housing question', which is in essence, `Is the private market model of housing provision separable from capitalist social relations?' and to which Engels replied categorically `No' (though it took a book to say it). But, like the housing question, the urban question is an invitation to deeper analysis of a superficially straightforward matter, with its roots, as is the case with so many concepts in critical social theory, planted firmly in Marx. This paper situates the urban question in history, tracing its lineage from Marx to Lefebvre to Castells to its recent iterations via Lefebvre's concept of planetary urbanisation. In the course of this journey the paper considers the meanings and usefulness of the question to critical urban research and action. The paper concludes that the underlying concepts of the evolving urban question do meaningfully engage with age-old and contemporary questions of how to bring about social change, and that their utility lies in the capacity of those asking the question to crystallise the possibilities of such change. },

	Abstract = {Urban studies today is marked by many active debates. In an earlier paper, we addressed some of these debates by proposing a foundational concept of urbanisation and urban form as a way of identifying a common language for urban research. In the present paper we provide a brief recapitulation of that framework. We then use this preliminary material as background to a critique of three currently influential versions of urban analysis, namely, postcolonial urban theory, assemblage theoretic approaches and planetary urbanism. We evaluate each of these versions in turn and find them seriously wanting as statements about urban realities. We criticise (a) postcolonial urban theory for its particularism and its insistence on the provincialisation of knowledge, (b) assemblage theoretic approaches for their indeterminacy and eclecticism and (c) planetary urbanism for its radical devaluation of the forces of agglomeration and nodality in urban-economic geography. {\copyright} 2016, {\copyright} Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.},
